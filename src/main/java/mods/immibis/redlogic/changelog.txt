57.3.1:
* Removed accidental requirement of CodeChickenLib.

57.3.0:
* Added null cells, invert cells, and non-invert cells.
* Null/invert/non-invert cells can be used in miniaturized circuits.
* Powered red alloy wires glow in the dark.
* Redstone Digitizers and integrated circuits can be rotated.
* Redstone Digitizers have a direction indicator on the top and bottom.
* Integrated circuits have a direction indicator on the top.
* Fixed wire rendering not using "face-specific shading". This makes them look more 3D.
* Changed the way that outside corners look when connecting different types of cables.
  (e.g: put bundled cable on any side of a block, and insulated wire on any other side except the opposite one)
* Fixed z-fighting in several situations.
* Gates can only be placed on a solid surface.
* Integrated circuits are now blocks in your inventory. If you have the old items, right-click anywhere to convert them.
* Fixed cage lamps sometimes rendering with the wrong brightness.
* Fixed z-fighting on "inside corners" of bundled cable.
* Fixed all texture mismatches on bundled cable (where the red and blue sides were swapped).
* Fixed some texture mismatches on freestanding bundled cable. It's not possible to fix all of these.
* Fixed block breaking particles for gates.
* Fixed block breaking particles for wires.
* Fixed lighting on dropped gate items.
* Fixed lighting on dropped wire items.
* Fixed not being able to place gates in the same block space as existing microblocks.
* Fixed creative middle-click on cleanroom air filters.
* Fixed client-side wire items sometimes being dropped (items that can't be picked up and disappear when the world is reloaded).

57.2.9:
* Fixed an exploitable server crash.

57.2.8:
* Added recipe for RedLogic comparators.

57.2.7:
* Added comparator gate. Works with vanilla redstone.
  Analog redstone on RedLogic wire is slightly different from vanilla redstone.
  Converting analog signals from RedLogic to vanilla is a bit weird.
* Fixed flat and cage lamps not dropping when broken normally.
* Fixed flat and cage lamps having wrong particles when broken.
* Fixed flat and cage lamps being highlighted when broken.
* Did not added the breaking animation to flat and cage lamps (similar to chests) - it would not be easy to make it work without being glitchy (not incredibly hard, just annoying like most rendering).


57.2.6:
* Freestanding wires work with integrated circuits.
* Fixed a potential error when scanning circuits.
* Fixed circuit compilers always facing the same way.
* Fixed chip fabricators always facing the same way.
* Decreased chip fabricator power cost. The cost is now 4000 EU or 1600 MJ - one coal piece - per chip. Still takes 20 seconds minimum.

57.2.5:
* Fixed lumar buttons and plates not dropping when the block they're attached to is broken.

57.2.4:
* Fixed lumar buttons and plates being unbreakable.

57.2.3:
* Fixed crash when opening gate GUIs.

57.2.2:
* Gates that don't initialize properly should not cause crashes (but they still won't work).
  Untested because I still can't reproduce this easily.
* Fixed timer and state cell GUI background.
* Fixed the block breaking animation on gates.

57.2.1:
* Added missing recipes for bundled AND/OR/NOT/XOR gates.

57.2.0:
* Added lumar buttons.
* Added lumar plates.
* Lumar buttons and plates support microblocks. Since microblocks don't block right-clicks you can make hidden buttons :O
* There are three types - normal, latchable, self-latching.
* Normal buttons are normal. They light up when not pressed and not receiving a redstone signal.
* Latchable buttons emit a short pulse, then stay pressed if something else is providing power.
* Self-latching buttons emit a short pulse, then stay pressed until something else provides power. Their output is inverted.
* Shift-right-click a button or plate with a screwdriver to change the light mode.
* All kinds can be recoloured by crafting them with a dye.

57.1.0:
* Added cage lamps and flat lamps.

57.0.3:
* Fixed gates having invisible sides.

57.0.2:
* Fixed lamps breaking instantly.
* Possibly fixed crash when breaking a gate with NEI Highlight Tips on.

57.0.1:

* Updated to Minecraft 1.6.4.
* Updated to experimental IC2.

56.1.1:
* Fixed a crash without Immibis's Microblocks installed.

56.1.0:
* Added bundled AND, OR, XOR and NOT gates. There is minor Z-fighting.

* Added a way to shrink circuits. The equipment required is quite expensive, but the individual chips are not.
* Added Cleanroom Wall, Cleanroom Air Filter, I/O Pin Marker, Redstone Digitizer, Schematic Compiler, Chip Fabricator.
* Added Schematic, Photomask and Integrated Circuit items.
* In this version repeaters, sequencers, state cells, randomizers, and non-RedLogic components (including vanilla) cannot be shrunk.
* In this version integrated circuits cannot be rotated and have no direction indicator.

* Fixed crash with red alloy wire near TC drawbridges? It still might not work right.
* Fixed counter GUI background.
* Fixed pistons flickering when signal strength became weaker without turning off.
* Might fix red alloy wires not working with WRCBE wireless transceivers.
* Might work without Immibis's Microblocks installed.

56.0.2:
* Added a recipe for insulated wire using wool.
* Fixed microblock placement check on gates being backwards.

56.0.1:
* Config option for minimum interval of timers and sequencers.
* NEI shouldn't show powered lamps and powered indicator lamps.
* Lamps have halos, except for indicator lamps, because they look stupid in the dark.
* Right-click a lamp with a dye to recolour it. The dye is not used up.

56.0.0:
* Updated to Minecraft 1.6.2.
* The coloured part of lamps is brighter and more symmetrical.
* Powered indicator lamps are visible even in complete darkness, even though they don't emit light.

55.4.1:
* Fixed freestanding red alloy wire not emitting a signal.
* Fixed torches on gates having the wrong texture after changing texture packs.
* Maybe fix the crash with unmelting ice?

55.4.0:
* Fixed some API derps before anyone has a chance to rely on them.
* XOR gates, XNOR gates, repeaters and pulse formers do not connect to wires on unused sides.
* Added Bundled Latch, Bundled Relay and Bundled Multiplexer.
* Added cube-shaped lamps.
* Wire can be placed on pistons and glowstone.

55.3.3:
* Fixed red alloy wires connecting to some blocks on the right sides (including WRCBE).
* Fixed crash when red alloy wire is next to a WRCBE block on certain sides (related to above).

55.3.2:
* Toggle flipflops have levers on them.
* Added D-latch and D-flipflop (Or D-flop for short).
  Flipflops trigger when their input turns on, and latches trigger constantly while the input is on. 
* T-latch renamed to T-flipflop to be consistent.
* Maybe fixed a crash when placing cable.

55.3.1:
* Fixed gates visually connecting to freestanding wire.

55.3.0:
* Added jacketed wire.
* Fixed rendering of outside corners where different types of wire connect.
* Fixed things not colliding with microblocks on wires.
* Fixed bundled cables not causing circuits to update?

55.2.1:
* Fixed outside corners not rendering properly (again) on plain red alloy wire.

55.2.0:
* Added bundled cable (yes, the texture doesn't match up on some corners).

55.1.2:
* Fixed outside corners not rendering properly (again).
* Fixed Z-fighting on the side of corners and T-intersections.
* Wires can't be collided with.

55.1.1:
* Fixed vanilla redstone input to gates.
* Outside corners render now. They have some Z-fighting (flickering) though.

55.1.0:
* Added insulated wire.
* Shift-click on a NOT gate with a screwdriver to disable outputs.
* Wires cannot be washed away by water.
* New bug: sometimes you get stuck on the edge of wire that you just placed.
  Seems to be an unavoidable side effect of the water fix, unless Mojang or Forge changes it.
* Gates internally use strength 0-255 instead of strength 0-15.
  Existing gates will have the wrong inputs and outputs until they get a block update.
* Improved wire rendering (fixed squished textures and Z-fighting).
  Inside corners have Z-fighting and outside corners don't render because I haven't done those yet.
* Fixed being able to put any size cover on a wire.
* Fixed wire breaking particles.
* Fixed timers emitting a pulse immediately after being started.

* Added /rldebug command. See /help for syntax. Admin-only.
* 'wire-reading' debug feature lets you right-click a wire to see the server-side and client-side strength.
  Will not work properly in SMP.
* 'wire-lag-particles' debug feature creates:
  * fire particles when a wire causes a block update.
  * bonemeal/villager particles when a wire sends a packet to the client.
  Recommended only for very small tests!
* 'wire-debug-particles' debug feature creates bonemeal/villager particles whenever a wire's strength changes.

55.0.2:
* Wires power blocks next to them, as in RP2.

55.0.1:
* Fixed timer and counter GUI backgrounds.
* Fixed rounding in timer GUI.
* Fixed texture on top and bottom of pointers.
* Fixed wires not receiving power from the block they're on.
* Fixed wires not providing power to the block they're on.
* Immibis's Microblocks 55.0.3 is required to fix another bug related to block updating.
* Red alloy wires will not power vanilla redstone - use a buffer or repeater. They still receive power from vanilla redstone.
* Fixed a crash when placing gates.
* Fixed wires popping off covers if you place a cover, then a wire on the cover, then a wire behind the cover.
* Fixed wires forming one-way connections through microblocks in certain arrangements.
* Fixed client-side wire drops.
* You can now right-click a toggle latch to change its state.

55.0.0:
* Fixed version number.

51.0.0:
* Initial release, with only red alloy wires and most gates from RP2.
